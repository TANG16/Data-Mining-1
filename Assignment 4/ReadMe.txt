Steps to run the code.

1. After pressing the execute button, a pop up window shall open. Please select the folder containing the data files.
2. Then a list of options will be displayed for each subtasks. For example FFT is option 3. 
3. Then input the feature you want to plot as a graph, here enter a number between 1 to 34.
4. 10 graphs each corresponding to a gesture will be plotted on screen. You can clearly observe the variation given by each feature.
5. The code keeps looping and we can use various feature techniques to plot various features to observe variance.
6. Press 8 to exit from the loop.
